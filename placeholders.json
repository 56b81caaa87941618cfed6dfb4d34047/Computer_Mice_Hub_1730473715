    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What types of computer mice are available?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "There are several types of computer mice, including optical mice, laser mice, wireless mice, ergonomic mice, and gaming mice. Each type offers different features and benefits to suit various user needs and preferences.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "How do I choose the right mouse for me?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "Consider factors such as your intended use (e.g., gaming, office work), ergonomics, connectivity options (wired or wireless), sensor type, and additional features like programmable buttons. Your budget and personal comfort preferences should also play a role in your decision.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "What is DPI and why is it important?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "DPI (Dots Per Inch) refers to the mouse's sensitivity. A higher DPI means the cursor moves further with less physical movement of the mouse. It's particularly important for gamers and graphic designers who need precise control. Many mice allow you to adjust the DPI to suit your needs.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "How do I maintain and clean my computer mouse?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_4": "Regular maintenance includes cleaning the mouse body with a slightly damp cloth, removing debris from the sensor with compressed air, and cleaning the mouse pad. For optical or laser mice, avoid looking directly into the light. Always consult your mouse's user manual for specific cleaning instructions.",

    "FAQ_SUBTITLE_PLACEHOLDER_TEXT": "Everything you need to know about computer mice",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_1": "What types of computer mice are available?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_1": "There are several types of computer mice, including optical, laser, wireless, ergonomic, gaming, and trackball mice. Each type has its own benefits and is suited for different needs and preferences.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_2": "How do I choose the right mouse for me?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_2": "Consider factors such as your intended use (e.g., gaming, office work), ergonomics, connectivity options, sensitivity (DPI), and budget. It's also helpful to try out different mice to find the most comfortable fit for your hand.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_3": "What is DPI and why does it matter?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_3": "DPI stands for Dots Per Inch and measures mouse sensitivity. Higher DPI allows for faster cursor movement with less physical mouse movement. This is particularly important for gaming and detailed graphic work.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_4": "How do I maintain and clean my mouse?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_4": "Regularly clean your mouse with a soft, lint-free cloth. For deeper cleaning, use a cotton swab slightly dampened with isopropyl alcohol to clean around buttons and seams. Avoid getting moisture inside the mouse and always unplug it before cleaning.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_5": "Are wireless mice as responsive as wired ones?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_5": "Modern wireless mice are highly responsive and can match the performance of wired mice. However, they require battery power and may experience interference in some environments. High-end wireless gaming mice often use advanced technology to minimize latency.",
